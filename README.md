reference code: for training and testing the model
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection


File videopretrained.py and imagepretrained.py is for testing the sample images and video using pretrained model


Libraries needed to install:

tensorflow==1.4.0


opencv-python


keras==2.0.0


For labeliing each image by class you need:

The video will  abit slow to detect due to using fasterrcnn resnet model if run on local computer not cloud
